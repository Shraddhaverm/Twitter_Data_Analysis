 Instructions to Use the System
To run the code and query the data on your computer, follow these steps:

Environment Setup:

.Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If you  donâ€™t have it installed, download and install it from the  official Python website.
.Install the pandas library using the command:
      pip install pandas
2.Create a Python Script:

Create a new Python script (e.g., tweet_analysis.py), and copy the code provided above into this file.
Modify File Path:

3.Update the file_path variable with the correct path to your TSV file.
Query the Data:

At the bottom of the script, you can call the functions like so:
term = "music"  # Example search term
print(count_tweets_per_day(term))
print(unique_users_count(term))
print(average_likes(term))
print(tweets_by_place(term))
print(tweets_times_of_day(term))
print(top_user(term))

4.Design Choices
      1.Using pandas: I chose pandas because it provides              powerful data manipulation capabilities, making it             easy to filter and aggregate the data.
      2. Functions: Each query is encapsulated in a separate          function, allowing for modularity and reusability.          You can easily call these functions with different          search terms as needed.
